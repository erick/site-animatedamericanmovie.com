<p>With cutting edge poise and striking elegance, doe-eyed beauty Bree Turner's graceful presence and self possessed style personify the definition of today's modern versatile actress. </p>

<p>As a child, Bree spent her time traveling the country with her family and her pro-football player father. During her teens, Turner's parents settled in Northern California where Bree first discovered a love for dance. In high school, she honed her talents in everything from ballet to jazz. When she moved to Los Angeles to study dance at UCLA, she was discovered by a dance agent and immediately landed roles as a dancer in countless high profile films such as "My Best Friend's Wedding", "She's All That" and "The Big Lebowski", among others. She danced her way into high profile nationally televised award shows and commercials, as well as major music videos with everyone from Brian Setzer to Sugar Ray. She appeared in spots for Hyundai, Gap, Dr. Pepper and the 2003 Budweiser spot "Top 10 of All-Time", which aired during the Super Bowl. Before she knew it, her passion had turned into a full fledged dancing career. </p>

<p>This career exposed her to countless hours on television and movie sets, where she truly felt right at home. She caught the acting bug and decided to turn her focus to this newfound passion. Turner credits her dancing for the focus she put forth towards acting, "As a dancer, you have to be disciplined. I spent most of my life living a disciplined existence, so I approach acting with the same serious mind set and really studied the craft", she recalls. Bree immersed herself in the new art, studying theater at King's College in London and enrolling in a series of acting classes with some of the best teachers in the business.</p>

<p>She immediately made her mark in Hollywood as Rob Schneider's love interest, "Allison the Fish Girl", in the ever popular movie "Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo", and as the snobby bouffant haired Tri-Pi "Tiffany" in "Sorority Boys". She opened the mega-hit "The Wedding Planner" as a nervous bride, alongside Jennifer Lopez and captivated audiences as the head cheerleader "Tina Hammersmith" in the hit film "Bring It On Again", where critics said, "Turner's performance as the monstrous child of privilege made the DVD worth a visit." In addition, she starred in the critically acclaimed Carsey/Werner/Mandabach Oxygen Network comedy "Good Girl's Don't..." as "Marjorie".</p>

<p>Turner has also made her mark within the independent film world including the Sundance award-winning "The Quest For Length", a critically acclaimed mockumentary in which Bree played the supportive girlfriend of a man who was on a comical quest to enlarge his penis. Not only do critics love her performance on the big screen, but they praise her for the work she does on stage as well. The Daily Variety writes that in "The Pages Of My Diary I'd Rather Not Read", "Turner creates an awe inspiring study of life-hardening resolve as steely eyed Ivy."</p>

<p>Recently, Bree wrapped the indie comedy "The Year of Getting to Know Us", starring Jimmy Fallon and "The TV Set", starring Sigourney Weaver. Bree can currently be seen in "Firehouse Dog", a story that follows "Rexxx", Hollywood's most in-demand canine star. Turner plays "Liz Knowles", a Hollywood film producer who is the force behind the famous celebrity dog. Also, you can catch her in "Just My Luck", a comedy starring Lindsay Lohan about the luckiest girl in the world who somehow loses it. Bree plays Lohan's best friend "Dana" who helps her troubled friend try and reclaim the luck she once had through a whirlwind of events. Bree also starred opposite Ethan Embry in Showtime's "Masters of Horror", an anthology series directed and co-written by famed filmmaker Don Coscarelli. Coscarelli states, "The moment Turner came into the audition, she nailed it, and I am pleased to finally feature a strong female protagonist."</p>

<p>With a resume of film and television credits most actors could only dream of, Bree Turner's unique and versatile talents have thrust her into the spotlight that has only just begun to shine. Well on her way to becoming one of Hollywood's hottest commodities, the elegant, graceful beauty electrifies the screen in a wide range of memorable work. When she is not working on a film or a television show, Bree spends her time honing her craft as an actress, working with charities and spending time with her family and friends.</p>
