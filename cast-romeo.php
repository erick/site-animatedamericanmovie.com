<p>Marc has appeared in various independent films most recently <em>The Curse of El Charro</em> and the upcoming <em>The Drone Virus</em>.  Marc began his acting career in Boston, MA where he worked mostly in theatre.  His favorite role was as Lance Cpl. Dawson in <em>A Few Good Men</em>.  He has lived in Los Angeles for the last 10 years studying acting and performing as much as his busy schedule allows.  Marc would like to thank the producers for including him in this project.  It was a great experience!</p>
