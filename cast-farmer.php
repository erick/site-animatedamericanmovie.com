<p>Bill Farmer has been vitally involved in the entertainment industry for more than 30 years. With a Bachelors degree in Broadcast Journalism from the University of Kansas and later studies in electronics which led to work in several radio stations across the country,  Bill began his career as an on-air personality as well as chief engineer with radio stations throughout the Midwest.  As a young man, Bill developed skills as an impressionist and comedian that soon led to a change in career from radio to that of a stand-up comedian. Bill performed stand-up comedy nationwide for several years and advanced to headliner in well-known clubs before moving to Los Angeles in the summer of 1986. Soon after arriving on the west coast, Bill signed with a theatrical agency and auditioned for his first animated characters, Disney’s voices of Goofy and Pluto. Bill continues voicing the Goof and Pluto to this day, and over the years, has voiced many other recognizable personalities, including Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Foghorn Leghorn, Sylvester the Cat, Yosemite Sam, and hundreds of other timeless characters. Bill remains a very active voice-over actor in animation as well as in commercials, video games, television, and film. Bill heads his own production company, Toonhouse Inc, which produces documentaries, PSA’s, and actor demos as well as teaching voice-over skills to new and young actors.</p>

<p>Bill has been a member of the Animation Peer Group Executive Committee with ATAS since 2003.</p>
